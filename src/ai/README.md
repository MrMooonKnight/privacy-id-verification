# AI Module

This module handles all artificial intelligence and machine learning aspects of the identity verification system, including biometric verification and fraud detection.

## Components

- **AIManager**: Main class that manages AI models for various verification tasks.
- **Face Recognition**: Verifies user identity using facial features.
- **Document Verification**: Validates government-issued ID documents.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies suspicious verification attempts.

## Features

- Facial recognition for biometric verification
- Government ID document analysis and validation
- Anomaly detection for fraud identification
- Continuously learning models that adapt to new patterns

## Implementation Details

The AI module uses multiple specialized models:

1. **Facial Recognition**: Uses face_recognition library to compare facial features between a reference image and a verification image.

2. **Document Verification**: (Simulated) Analyzes document images to extract information and verify authenticity.

3. **Fraud Detection**: Uses Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in verification patterns that might indicate fraud.

## Privacy Considerations

All AI processing is designed with privacy in mind:
- Biometric templates are stored, not raw biometric data
- Models are run locally when possible to minimize data sharing
- Results are presented as confidence scores rather than raw data
