# Identity Module

This module is the core of the identity verification system, coordinating between blockchain, AI, and cryptography to provide secure identity management.

## Components

- **IdentityManager**: Main class that coordinates the identity verification processes.
- **Registration**: User identity registration and storage.
- **Verification**: Identity verification using various methods.
- **Permission Management**: Control of access permissions to identity data.
- **Compliance**: Enforcement of regulatory compliance for data handling.

## Features

- Secure registration of user identities
- Multi-factor identity verification (biometric, document)
- User-controlled data access permissions
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- Fraud detection and prevention

## Implementation Details

The identity module acts as a coordinator between other modules:

1. **Registration Process**:
   - Collects user data, biometric data, and document data
   - Uses the crypto module to securely hash and encrypt the data
   - Stores data hash on the blockchain via the blockchain module
   - Stores encrypted data locally (in a real system, this would use a secure database)

2. **Verification Process**:
   - Supports multiple verification methods (facial, document)
   - Uses the AI module to perform verification operations
   - Records verification events on the blockchain
   - Ensures compliance with privacy regulations

3. **Permissions Management**:
   - Allows users to control who can access their identity data
   - Uses blockchain to maintain an immutable record of permissions
   - Implements zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification

## Privacy and Security

- Data minimization: Only necessary data is collected and stored
- Purpose limitation: Data is only used for specified verification purposes
- Storage limitation: Data retention periods are enforced
- Encrypted storage: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Zero-knowledge verification: Identity can be verified without revealing sensitive information
