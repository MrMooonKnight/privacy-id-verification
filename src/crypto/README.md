# Crypto Module

This module handles all cryptographic operations and privacy-preserving techniques, including encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and homomorphic encryption.

## Components

- **CryptoManager**: Main class that manages cryptographic operations.
- **Data Encryption**: Secure encryption of identity data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verification of claims without revealing underlying data.
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Performing computations on encrypted data.

## Features

- End-to-end encryption of identity data
- Zero-knowledge proofs for private verification
- Homomorphic encryption for secure data processing
- Secure hashing for blockchain storage

## Implementation Details

The crypto module uses various cryptographic techniques:

1. **AES-256 Encryption**: Used for secure storage of identity data.

2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: (Simulated) Enables verification of claims without revealing the underlying data. For example, proving a user is over 18 without revealing their exact age.

3. **Homomorphic Encryption**: (Simulated) Allows computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first.

4. **Secure Hashing**: Creates cryptographic hashes of identity data for secure storage on the blockchain.

## Security Considerations

- All cryptographic keys are securely managed and stored
- Industry-standard algorithms are used for all cryptographic operations
- The module includes protections against common cryptographic attacks
- A layered approach to security ensures multiple levels of protection

**Note**: The current implementation includes simulated versions of zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, these would be replaced with actual implementations using libraries like ZoKrates, Snarkjs, and TenSEAL.
