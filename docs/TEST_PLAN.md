# Blockchain Integration Test
def test_store_identity_hash():
    bc_utils = BlockchainUtils()
    tx_receipt = bc_utils.store_identity_hash("0x123", "0xabc123")
    assert tx_receipt.status == 1  # Transaction successful
    stored_hash = bc_utils.get_identity_hash("0x123")
    assert stored_hash == "0xabc123"
```

test('API call formats data correctly', async () => {
  const mockFetch = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    ok: true,
    json: async () => ({ success: true })
  });
  global.fetch = mockFetch;
  
  await api.verifyIdentity({ userId: '123', faceData: 'base64...' });
  
  expect(mockFetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.stringContaining('/api/verify'),
    expect.objectContaining({
      method: 'POST',

  const thirdParty = accounts[2];
  
  beforeEach(async () => {
    instance = await IdentityVerification.new({ from: owner });
  });
  
  it("should store an identity hash", async () => {
    await instance.storeIdentityHash("0xabc123", { from: user });
    const storedHash = await instance.getIdentityHash({ from: user });
    assert.equal(storedHash, "0xabc123", "Identity hash was not stored correctly");
  });
  
  it("should manage access control correctly", async () => {
    await instance.storeIdentityHash("0xabc123", { from: user });
    
    // Initially, third party should not have access
    let hasAccess = await instance.checkAccess(thirdParty, { from: user });
    assert.equal(hasAccess, false, "Third party should not have access initially");
    
    // Grant access
    await instance.grantAccess(thirdParty, { from: user });
    hasAccess = await instance.checkAccess(thirdParty, { from: user });
    assert.equal(hasAccess, true, "Third party should have access after granting");
    
    // Revoke access
    await instance.revokeAccess(thirdParty, { from: user });
    hasAccess = await instance.checkAccess(thirdParty, { from: user });
    assert.equal(hasAccess, false, "Third party should not have access after revoking");
