# Blockchain-Based AI for Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification

A comprehensive solution that combines blockchain technology with AI for secure, private identity verification.

## Project Overview

This system enables secure identity verification through:
- Biometric verification (facial recognition, fingerprints)
- Government ID verification
- Blockchain-based data storage and access control
- Privacy-preserving techniques (zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption)
- AI-driven fraud detection

## Directory Structure

- `backend/`: Flask REST API for the main application
- `frontend/`: User interface for identity submission and verification
- `blockchain/`: Smart contracts and blockchain integration
- `ai_models/`: Machine learning models for verification and fraud detection
- `utils/`: Shared utilities and helper functions
- `contracts/`: Solidity smart contracts for identity management
- `docs/`: Documentation and additional resources

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Ethereum development environment (Ganache, Truffle)
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd blockchain-ai-identity
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```
   cd blockchain
   truffle migrate --reset
   ```

6. Start the application:
   ```
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   python app.py
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## Testing

Run the following command to execute tests:
```
python -m pytest
```

## Security and Privacy

This system is designed with privacy and security as core principles:
- End-to-end encryption
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- Homomorphic encryption for computations on encrypted data
- Decentralized storage on blockchain
- User-controlled data sharing
