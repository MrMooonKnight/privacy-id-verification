# Blockchain-Based AI for Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification

A secure, privacy-focused identity verification system that leverages blockchain technology and AI to provide robust identity management while preserving user privacy.

## Features

- **Biometric Verification**: Facial recognition and fingerprint verification
- **Document Verification**: Support for government-issued IDs
- **Blockchain Storage**: Immutable, decentralized identity data storage
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated verification processes
- **Privacy Preservation**: Zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption
- **AI-Driven Fraud Detection**: Machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities
- **User Control**: Granular access permissions for identity data

## System Architecture

The system is divided into several modules:

- **Blockchain Module**: Handles all blockchain interactions, smart contracts, and decentralized storage
- **Identity Module**: Manages identity verification processes and documentation
- **AI Module**: Implements ML models for verification and fraud detection
- **Crypto Module**: Provides cryptographic functions, including zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption
- **Interface Module**: Manages user interfaces and API endpoints

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-identity-verification.git
cd blockchain-identity-verification

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up configuration
cp config.example.yml config.yml
# Edit config.yml with your specific settings
```

## Usage

```bash
# Start the server
python src/main.py

# Run tests
pytest
```

## Development

This project follows a modular architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability. Each module has its own responsibilities and interfaces with other modules through well-defined APIs.

## Compliance

This system is designed to comply with:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- W3C DID (Decentralized Identifiers) standards
